# DadeCore WordPress Theme

DadeCore is a corporate base theme optimized for modern WordPress development. It supports the Gutenberg block editor and popular builders like Elementor.

## Installation

   ```
2. Log into your WordPress admin dashboard and activate the **DadeCore Theme** from the *Appearance â†’ Themes* menu.

### Build Requirements

The theme styles are written in SCSS. You can compile them with any Sass compiler. For example:

```

Make sure the generated CSS files are available in the theme before activating it.

## Usage Notes

- Compatible with Gutenberg blocks and Elementor widgets out of the box.

- JavaScript enhancements can be added in `assets/js/main.js`.
